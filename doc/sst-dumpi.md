## Using SST Dumpi



### Outputs
If nothing else is specified, trace files are dumped inside the directory of execution of the MPI program. In order to control the location of the trace files, it is recommended to create a specific folder for collecting them. One way of specifying where to store trace files, is to include a dumpi.conf file with the relevant information, in the execution directory. For more information on the dumpi.conf file and for an example template, refer to the [Dumpi user manual](https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-dumpi/blob/master/docs/user.dox), specifically, section ”Runtime configuration of the DUMPI trace library”.
